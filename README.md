# JetML-ImageClassifier

This simple application was written with the main purpose of learning <b>Jetpack Compose, Tensorflow Light and Palette API</b>.<br><br>
JetML Image Classifier allows user to recognize what is in the photo using a machine learning model. A trained TensorFlow Light model was used.<br> 
The photo can be selected both from the gallery and from the camera. The user is asked for permission to use the gallery or camera during runtime. <br> <br>
<b>The background of the results is matched to the currently checked photo using Google Pallete API.</b><br><br> 

Additionally, thanks to the new possibilities of Jetpack Compose, animating bars and pie chart was a pleasure and the effect is very nice looking <br><br>

The application is written in mvvm architecture using dagger hilt as dependency injection, uses kotlin coroutines and works both in night and day mode depending on phone settings.<br><br>
